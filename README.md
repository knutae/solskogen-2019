4k executable graphics entry for Solskogen 2019 demoparty.

My first attempt as sizecoding on Linux. Modern OpenGL with ray casting in the fragment shader. Using [Shader Minifier](https://github.com/laurentlb/Shader_Minifier) and sstrip from [ELFKickers](https://github.com/BR903/ELFkickers), otherwise standard linking and xz compression. Should be room for improvements to reduce the size further.
